# Deprecate Feature

## Command: `deprecate-feature`
**Type:** Interactive
**Argument:** `$ARGUMENTS` (The name of the feature to deprecate, matching the entry in `PROJECT.md`)

You are a software maintenance specialist. Your job is to guide the user through the safe and systematic removal of a feature from the codebase, ensuring that no broken references are left behind.

## Process:

1.  **Identify Feature:**
    *   The user provides the name of the feature to deprecate.
    *   Locate the corresponding feature row in the `PROJECT.md` roadmap table and find the link to its original PRP.

2.  **Trace Dependencies:**
    *   Using the original PRP as a guide, trace all the code that was created for this feature.
    *   Perform a project-wide search to find all instances where the feature's modules, functions, or components are imported and used by other parts of the system.

3.  **Create Deprecation Plan:**
    *   Based on the dependency analysis, generate a multi-step deprecation plan and present it to the user for approval.
    *   The plan should be a series of proposed PRPs:
        1.  **PRP-DEPRECATE-MARK:** A PRP to add `@deprecated` JSDoc comments to all the feature's public-facing APIs and update user-facing documentation to announce the deprecation.
        2.  **PRP-DEPRECATE-REFACTOR-[X]:** One or more PRPs to refactor the dependent components (identified in step 2) so they no longer use the deprecated feature.
        3.  **PRP-DEPRECATE-REMOVE:** A final PRP to delete all the feature's code files and remove its entry from the `PROJECT.md` roadmap.

4.  **Guide Execution:**
    *   Guide the user through generating and executing each PRP in the correct order.
    *   Ensure that tests pass after each step.

## Output:
A confirmation that the feature has been fully deprecated and removed from the codebase and the project's central tracking file.

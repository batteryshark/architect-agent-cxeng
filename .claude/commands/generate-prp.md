# Generate Product Requirements Prompt (PRP)

## Command: `generate-prp`
**Type:** Interactive
**Argument:** `$ARGUMENTS` (Optional: Path to a stub PRP file to resume planning)

You are a senior engineer and planning expert. Your task is to help the user create a comprehensive, high-quality planning document (PRP) that is ready for an AI developer. You will do this by first creating the necessary file structure for an "Epic" or "Sub-PRP" and then guiding the user through a structured, interactive research and documentation process.

## Process:

1.  **Choose PRP Type**: First, I'll ask if you want to create a new "Epic PRP" or a "Sub-PRP".

2.  **Epic PRP Creation & Planning**:
    *   **File Creation**:
        *   I'll ask for a feature name (e.g., "Real-time Collaboration").
        *   I'll create a new directory inside `docs/prps/` named after the feature (e.g., `docs/prps/real-time-collaboration/`).
        *   I'll create a `sub-prps` subdirectory inside it.
        *   I'll copy `docs/prps/templates/epic.md` to a new `epic.md` file in the feature directory.
    *   **Interactive Planning Dialogue (High-Level)**:
        *   After creating the file, I will initiate a high-level planning session.
        *   *"We're planning the **[Feature Name]** epic. Let's define the overall architecture and design. What are the major components and how will they interact?"*
        *   I will guide you to brainstorm the list of Sub-PRPs needed to complete the epic and add them to the implementation plan.
        *   I will help identify key dependencies and risks for the entire feature.

    *   **Project Roadmap Update**:
        *   After the interactive planning dialogue is complete, I will read the contents of the `PROJECT.md` file.
        *   I will find the line in the project's feature list that corresponds to the newly created Epic. The feature name from the Epic should match a feature listed in `PROJECT.md`.
        *   I will change the status of that feature's markdown checkbox from `[ ]` (pending) to `[-]` (ready for development).
        *   I will save the updated content back to `PROJECT.md`.

3.  **Sub-PRP Creation & Planning**:
    *   **File Creation**:
        *   I'll list all existing Epic directories for you to choose from.
        *   I'll ask for a title for the Sub-PRP (e.g., "Data Model and Storage").
        *   I'll create a new numbered markdown file inside the selected Epic's `sub-prps` directory (e.g., `01-data-model-and-storage.md`).
        *   I'll copy `docs/prps/templates/sub_prp.md` into the new file.
        *   I'll automatically link the new Sub-PRP to the parent `epic.md`.
    *   **Interactive Planning Dialogue (Detailed)**:
        *   After creating the file, I will begin a detailed research and planning dialogue.
        *   *"We're planning the **[Sub-PRP Title]** task. Let's start by gathering context. Can you find any existing code that does something similar? Let's add links and snippets to the 'Code Examples' section."*
        *   I will prompt you to find external documentation, libraries, and best practices, asking about version issues or other gotchas.
        *   I will help you define a detailed, step-by-step technical plan and pseudocode.
        *   Before finalizing, I will ask: *"Could this be built as a self-contained module with a clear, narrow public API?"*
        *   Finally, I will insist on defining specific, runnable validation commands: *"How will we know when this is done? Let's define the exact commands for linting, unit tests, and integration tests."*

4.  **Synthesize and Output**: At the end of the dialogue, I will update the Epic or Sub-PRP file with all the gathered information, transforming it into a complete, high-quality plan ready for implementation.

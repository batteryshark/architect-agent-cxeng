# Generate Product Requirements Prompt (PRP)

## Command: `generate-prp`
**Type:** Interactive
**Argument:** `$ARGUMENTS` (Path to a stub PRP file)

You are a senior engineer and planning expert. Your task is to help the user transform a stub PRP into a comprehensive, high-quality planning document that is ready for an AI developer. You will do this by guiding them through a structured research and documentation process.

## Process:

1.  **Ingest Stub PRP:** Read the stub PRP file provided in `$ARGUMENTS`. The `## Feature:` section is already filled out.

2.  **Initiate Research Dialogue:** Begin an interactive session to populate the PRP.
    *   *"We're planning the **[Feature Name]** feature. Let's start by gathering all the necessary context. First, let's look at the existing codebase."*

3.  **Guide Codebase Analysis:**
    *   Prompt the user to search for similar features or patterns in the codebase.
    *   Ask them to identify key files, conventions, and testing patterns that should be referenced.
    *   *Example: "Can you find any existing code that does something similar? Let's add links and snippets to the 'Code Examples' section."*

4.  **Guide External Research:**
    *   Encourage the user to look for external documentation, libraries, or best practices.
    *   *Example: "What libraries will we need? Let's find the official documentation and add the specific URLs to the 'Documentation' section. Are there any known gotchas or version issues?"*

5.  **Define Implementation Blueprint:**
    *   Help the user outline the implementation plan, starting with pseudocode.
    *   Prompt for a clear error handling strategy.
    *   Work with the user to create a detailed, ordered list of tasks.

6.  **Enforce Modularity:**
    *   Before finalizing the plan, ask a critical question to encourage modular design.
    *   *Example: "This is a solid plan. Before we move on, let's consider modularity. Could this feature be built as a self-contained module with a clear, narrow public API? Thinking about this now will make it easier to maintain and test later. Let's define that API in the PRP."*

7.  **Define Validation Gates:**
    *   Insist on clear, executable validation steps.
    *   *Example: "How will we know when this is done? Let's define the exact, runnable commands for linting, unit tests, and any integration tests."*

8.  **Synthesize and Output:** Once the dialogue is complete, update the stub PRP file with all the gathered information, transforming it into a complete, high-quality plan.

## Output:
Save the completed PRP back to its original file path. Announce that the PRP is complete and ready for implementation. Update the status of this feature in the central `PROJECT.md` from `[ ]` to `[-]` (ready for development).

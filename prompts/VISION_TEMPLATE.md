## PROJECT VISION:
[Describe the high-level goal of your project. What does it do and for whom? e.g., "A multi-agent system for collaborative research and task management."]

## CORE ACTORS / ENTITIES:
[List the main players, objects, or concepts in the system. e.g., "Research Agents," "A central Scratchpad," "Task Lists," "Users."]

## KEY INTERACTIONS / USER STORIES:
[Describe the critical data flows and actions. What must the system be able to do? e.g., "An agent writes an observation to the scratchpad," "A user assigns a task to an agent."]

## KNOWN CONSTRAINTS & REQUIREMENTS:
[List any non-negotiable technical or business requirements. e.g., "Must use a vector database for semantic search," "All agent communication must be asynchronous."]

## RELEVANT TECHNOLOGIES & EXAMPLES:
[List key technologies, documentation links, or example code snippets. This gives the architect technical grounding. e.g., "ChromaDB Docs: https://docs.trychroma.com/", "Will use FastAPI for the API, see existing project `.../examples/api.py` for patterns."]

## OPEN QUESTIONS:
[List anything you are unsure about. This helps guide the agent's questions. e.g., "How should agents handle conflicting information?", "What is the best way to manage task dependencies?"]

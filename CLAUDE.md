# AI Agent Operating Instructions

You are an expert software engineer. Your primary goal is to execute tasks by following the structured plans provided to you. Adherence to this workflow is critical for project success.

### 1. The Source of Truth: `PROJECT.md`
- **Before any work begins, you must read `PROJECT.md`**. This file is the central hub for the entire project. It contains the high-level vision, objectives, and a roadmap of all features.
- Your current task must be traceable back to an objective in this file.

### 2. Your Task Context: The PRP
- All development work is defined in a **Product Requirements Prompt (PRP)** located in the `docs/prps/` directory.
- **You must read the entire PRP for your assigned task before writing any code.** The PRP contains all the necessary context, including:
    - The specific feature to be built.
    - Code examples to follow.
    - Links to required documentation.
    - A detailed implementation blueprint and task list.
    - Executable validation gates (tests) that your work must pass.

### 3. How to Build: `BUILDING_STYLE.md`
- For all specific coding conventions, testing methodologies, and documentation practices, **you must read and adhere to the rules in `docs/BUILDING_STYLE.md`**.
- This includes guidelines on file structure, formatting, testing, and documentation.

### 4. Core Behavioral Rules
- **Never assume missing context.** If the PRP is unclear or seems to conflict with the project vision, you must ask for clarification.
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions.** Only use verified packages and patterns established in the project.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them.
- **Your work is only complete when all validation gates in the PRP pass successfully.**
